# The First Muslim Chaplain In U.S. Armed Forces

## Historical Significants


  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Islamic countries and places with significant populations of Muslims have been in and out of the news regularly for well over 30 years. Many countries have gotten aid for different situations, like during natural disasters, famine, the spread of diseases, or any other assistance from international bodies. Islamic countries and applicable, in particular, have gotten more intense military aid than others in this timeline. As justified as the aid was, it brought upon these countries a lot of attention both good and bad. This attention not only affected the countries involved but those that follow the Islamic faith. Many Muslims during this time experienced a shift in treatment from those around them due to the perception that was given from the news. The terms used in the news by the opposing groups caused a lot of unrest among those in international countries. So, during the _Persian Gulf War_ and then the following _Iraq war_, tensions continued to rise. When the attack on the Twin Towers occurred, it was practically the breaking point for people. This was simply the final nail that pinned the word terrorism to label Muslims. With that knowledge in mind, when Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Rasheed Muhammad, an Iman (the equivalent of a religious leader/scholar in other faiths), decided to join the US Armed Forces and then later become a Chaplin is admirable.

### Religious/Emotional Significants

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An army chaplain is a religious leader qualified in dedicating their service to soldiers and their families. Chaplains provide support to soldiers and families in both peace and war worldwide. 
  
  “_The army is a pluralistic environment. Rabbis, Ministers, Imams, and Priests serve our soldiers with conviction and commitment. While serving their own faith groups in the Army, chaplains also ensure and provide the means for others to observe their own faith in accordance with United States law_.”[^second] 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At most before Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Rasheed Muhammad became the first Muslim chaplain, there were only representatives for other faiths. Roman Catholic priests, Dutch reformists, Methodists, Rabbis, etc. were the only kind of chaplains since 1775. 


  **ARM**: "We didn’t have any Islamic chaplains in the military. And so, I really didn’t have a template." <a href="javascript:seek(16)"> 00:16</a>


  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Army chaplains are usually non-combatant and are considered religious affairs specialists. They are still fully trained in tasks any soldier should know along with the religious support tasks. Being able to finally bring an Islamic religious leader to those that follow the faith in the US Army can bring more ease to such an emotionally and physically tasking job. This is especially important during this time, with religion being such a hot topic and causing such harsh reactions. Islam a trigger word for some, the Lieutenant did not know how people would react to this new religious figure in the military.


  **ARM**: "In the early days, I certainly anticipated that I probably was gonna have challenges. But I got a whole lot of people reaching out to me and saying, ‘Hey, if you need anything…’ And these were senior chaplains. So, that was a pleasant surprise." <a href="javascript:seek(22)"> 00:22</a>


  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Chaplain, his job is to deal with supporting soldiers and families through grief and times of hardship. Soldiers face a wide range of emotions such as denial, yearning, anger, shock, guilt, despair, and cause people to react badly and lash out.  When the cause of this grief is associated with faith, it's hard for a representative of said faith to approach them. The lieutenant dealt with such thoughts and pushed through them so that he can better help those around him.


  **ARM**: "You know, the questions that I asked myself, I felt were very legitimate questions. Like, ‘Should I be here doing this?’ And then, I would suddenly realize in the next thought, ‘Yes, I should. Who else is there?’ That would always help me to get through." <a href="javascript:seek(78)"> 01:18</a> 





### Military Significance

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_The Persian Gulf War_, which began on August 2, 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, was a major international conflict. It was the post-Cold War era's first major international crisis. Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein, ordered the invasion and occupation of Kuwait with the claimed goals of gaining Kuwait's large oil reserves, repaying a significant debt due to Kuwait, and strengthening Iraq's regional dominance. The United States' response would set important precedents for the use of armed force in the decades ahead. 


  **ARM**: "When I was deployed to Iraq, going to war with the prospect of not knowing whether you’d come back home was something that was always on the mind of our soldiers. And before we left, I recall my commander saying to the spouses that he would do everything in his power to bring everyone back. And, of course, four of us didn’t come back. <a href="javascript:seek(43)"> 00:43</a>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _The Iraq War_, often known as the Second Persian Gulf War, was a conflict in Iraq that lasted from 2003 until 2011. In April 2003, a multinational force led by the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries invaded Iraq, decimating Iraqi military and paramilitary forces. The United States gradually reduced its military presence in the country, eventually leaving completely in December 2011. Unlike the agreement struck during the Persian Gulf War, no broad coalition was created to depose Saddam Hussein and his regime. In the United States, the fight produced diverse reactions. Many saw the war as a reckless act of internationalism. As the violence worsened, more Americans changed their views and began to criticize the Bush administration for their actions. Photographs of US forces abusing Iraqis at the Abu Ghraib jail west of Baghdad made the news, significantly damaging the US's international image. In addition, a bipartisan commission set up by the US government to investigate the September 11 attacks found no evidence of a "collaborative operational relationship" between the Baathist government and al-Qaeda in July 2004, contradicting one of the US government's main justifications for the war.


  **SM**: "You’re definitely one of the strongest people that I’ve ever met and you have an integrity that I can admire and strive towards. So, thank you."
  
  **ARM**: "Thank you."<a href="javascript:seek(122)"> 02:22</a>
